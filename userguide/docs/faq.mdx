# Frequently Asked Questions

This section aims to answer some common questions as well as covering some pitfals you might experience when using the NeoForge installer.

## Troubleshooting the NeoForge Installer

### Troubleshooting the NeoForge Installer on Windows

File associations for executing Java applications are sometimes missing or otherwise misconfigured.

For example, running the installer may momentarily flash up a black window, present the `Open with ...` dialog box, or it might open in a file archiving program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.

To fix this, download and run (double-click) [JarFix], a program designed to fix broken or missing file associations.

Once complete, restart your computer and try running the installer again.

### Troubleshooting the NeoForge Installer on Linux

File associations for executing Java applications are often missing completely on Linux distributions.

In order to run the installer you may need to execute it manually in a terminal.

For instance, with an installer for NeoForge version `21.1.54`, running the following in a terminal should bring up its GUI:

```
$ java -jar neoforge-21.1.54-installer.jar
```

For pointers on how to find a terminal application on Linux, see [Locating Terminal Application].

## Troubleshooting NeoForge

## The installer crashed and I don't know why!

Most users won't experience any issues when running the installer, but sometimes things do go wrong.  The installer should create a log file, with the same name as the installer, only with a `.log` file extension instead of `.jar`.  The installer log file can be used to find out what went wrong.

Let's say that you downloaded the installer for NeoForge version `21.1.42` and saved the file to your desktop.  The log file from the installer should be on your desktop with a filename of `neoforge-21.1.42-installer.log`.

You might be able to figure out why the installer failed by reading the log file but, if you're unsure of how to interpret its contents, join the [NeoForge Discord] and ask in the `#user-support` channel.

:::note
If you have an outdated version of Java 8 installed on your computer, the installer may fail due to outdated SSL certificates that are bundled with it.  Upgrading to a newer version of Java should fix this.
:::

## My game crashed and it said something about drivers?

Due to an interaction between NeoForge's early-loading screen and outdated/buggy graphics card (GPU) drivers, the game may crash shortly after loading.  This can sometimes be fixed by upgrading the drivers for your GPU.

:::note
It's possible that your computer may have multiple GPUs, including one which is integrated into the CPU itself as well as a dedicated (also known as discrete) GPU.  If you don't know how many GPUs you have or which drivers to update, you can ask for help in the `#user-support` channel on the [NeoForge Discord] server.
:::

It might be possible to fix by updating your drivers.  To update your drivers, use one of the following tools provided by the three most common brands:

- **Intel**: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html

- **AMD**: https://www.amd.com/en/support

- **NVIDIA**: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx
