# Checking for and Installing Java

This section provides instructions on how to check whether you already have Java installed and how where to obtain a copy when it is not already installed.

If you are sure that you do not already have Java installed, proceed the final section entitled [Installing Java] below.

## Checking for Existing Java Installation

To find out if you already have Java, you will need to locate and run the terminal application that is provided by your OS.

### Location Terminal Application

The name of the applications to use differs based on the OS that is running:

<Tabs defaultValue="windows">
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    On Windows, one of the following should be available:
    - Windows Terminal
    - PowerShell
    - Command Prompt (aka `cmd`)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    On macOS there is the `Terminal.app` often found on the Finder dock.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    On Linux, using your window manager's main menu, you should have at least one such application, usually named just `Terminal` though could have other names such as `Console, `Konsole` or similar.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing for Installed Java Version

Once you have located your OS's terminal application, run the command `java -version` which should present you with information similar to the following:

```
openjdk version "21.0.4" 2024-07-16 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.4+7 (build 21.0.4+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.4+7 (build 21.0.4+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```
