# Installing NeoForge

## Running The Installer

The NeoForge installer is OS-agnostic and is universal in that it can be used to install on both the client and server.

With Java installed, you should be able to just double-click the installer's `.jar` file and proceed from there.

If double-clicking does not work, or your OS presents you with an error when doing so, see the section [Troubleshooting the NeoForge Installer] of the [FAQ].

## Installing NeoForge on a Server

You might want to install NeoForge on a "headless" server which does not have a GUI and therefore no means of double-clicking to run the installer.

Usually this will mean that you need to use remote-access software such as [OpenSSH] to open a terminal and install NeoForge via the command line.

Once you have opened a connection to the server you want to install on, the process is similar to that in the [] section of the [FAQ] with one extra `--installServer`.

For example, to install a NeoForge server, version `21.1.51`, run the following command:

```
java -jar neoforge-21.1.51-installer.jar --installServer
```

This command will install the NeoForge server to the current working directory by default.

If this is not what you want, specify the path you want to install to after the `--installServer`, e.g. by replacing the last `--installServer` with `--installServer /path/to/install/to`.
