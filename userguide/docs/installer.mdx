# Installing NeoForge

## Running The Installer

The NeoForge installer is OS-agnostic and is universal in that it can be used to install on both the client and server.

With Java installed, you should be able to just double-click the installer's `.jar` file and proceed from there.

If double-clicking does not work, or your OS presents you with an error when doing so, see the section [Troubleshooting the NeoForge Installer] of the [FAQ].
